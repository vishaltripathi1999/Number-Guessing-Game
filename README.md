# Number-Guessing-Game
# A number guessing game is a simple guessing game where a user is supposed to guess a number between 0 and N in a maximum of 10 attempts. The game will end after 10 attempts and if the player failed to guess the number, and then he loses the game. Examples: N = 100. Number chosen: 20
# random() method in Java. Now using a loop, take K input from the user and for each input print whether the number is smaller or larger than the actual number. If within K trials the user guessed the number correctly, print that the user won. Else print that he was not able to guess and then print the actual number
